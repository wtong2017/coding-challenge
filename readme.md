# How to run

Please host a local server, e.g. using http-server ```npm i http-server```. 

1. Run ```http-server``` in the foot folder.
2. Open ```http://localhost:8080``` using web browser.

For level 4, open ```level4/level4.ipynb``` using Jupyter Notebook.

For level 6, React + Redux and Flask are used as frontend and backend respectively. mongoDB is used for database. (WIP)

1. Go to folder ```level6/backend```, install required libraries by ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` (in virual python environment).
2. Run ```python app.py``` to start the backend server.
3. Go to folder ```../frontend```, install required modules by ```npm install```.
4. Run ```npm start``` to start the frontend server.
5. Open ```http://localhost:8080``` using web browser.

Justification:
1. For level 1 and 2, I used another color scheme.
2. For level 3, I used bar chart instead of line chart to display the daily temperature.
